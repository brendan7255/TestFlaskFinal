# CIS371_Semester_Project
The web app that i will be making for this project is going to be an outfit picking web app.

The functions of this web app will be the ability to press a button and have a random outfit chosen for you
There will be a page you upload a picture and fill out a form along with it storing information such as the color, category, and other details.
It will use that information to match a top and bottom show you it on the randomizing page


- There will be user accounts that show just that persons clothes
- a page for users to upload pictures
- fill out a form for the description of the piece
- randomize page will have a randomize button that gives you a random outfit
- randomize page will have a like and dislike button on it
- add a favorites tab that stores the liked outfits to a database and shows all liked combinations
- There will be a history page that shows previous outfits including disliked
- dislike button will make sure that combination doesnt show up again

Possible features
- locking in certain piece and randomizing the rest again
- Implement weather and location api to allow user to specify where they are located
- choose clothing pieces based on weather and location
- possibly have remove and reset button
  - remove would be used when item is worn so it wont be showed again
  - reset will add back all items
    - so after doing laundry you can reset it and when its worn you can remove it
- Search feature with editable parameters such as searching for red short sleeve shirts
